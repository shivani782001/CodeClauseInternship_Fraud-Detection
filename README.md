# CodeClauseInternship_Fraud-Detection

Completed as part of my Data Science internship at CodeClause, this project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. By applying anomaly detection and classification algorithms, we identify potential fraudulent activities with a focus on model accuracy and interpretability.

Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing
Scikit-Learn: Model training and evaluation
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

Project Details:

The dataset includes transaction features processed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for privacy. This project covers:

Data Preprocessing: Standardizing numerical features and handling class imbalance.

Anomaly Detection: Using isolation forest and local outlier factor (LOF) methods for detecting anomalies.

Classification Modeling: Training models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

Evaluation: Assessing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust fraud detection.
